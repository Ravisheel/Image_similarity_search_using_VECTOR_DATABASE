# Image_similarity_search_using_VECTOR_DATABASE


In the realm of modern data-driven applications, the ability to find similarities among vast sets of images is paramount. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, this project delves into the creation of an Image Similarity Search Using Vector Database. The journey began by harnessing the power of transfer learning, employing the sophisticated Squeeze net v1 model to convert images into efficient vector embeddings. I have used 20,000-dimension vector embeddings (numerical representations), representing the essence of the images, were seamlessly stored using Pinecone, a robust vector database, which can store data embeddings like, text, image, and speech.

The primary objective of this project is to build a system that allows users to search for similar images within a vast collection, leveraging the power of vector embeddings. The project aims to create an efficient, scalable, and accurate Image Similarity Search system that can be applied to various domains, such as content recommendation, image retrieval, and more.

What is Vector Database Management System

A VDBMS is a specialized type of DBMS that focuses primarily on the efficient management of high-dimensional vector data. This means that VDBMSs are designed to store and retrieve vector data quickly and efficiently, even for very large datasets. Similarly, to other types of DBMSs, VDBMSs must be able to manage data.This includes tasks such as data querying and manipulation, collection of metadata, indexing, access control, backups, and support for scalability. VDBMSs focus on the management of vector data. This means that VDBMSs provide features that are specifically designed for vector data,such as efficient storage and retrieval, support for similarity search, and support for efficient indexing.
VDBMSs are used in a variety of applications, including:
• Recommender systems
• Fraud detection
• Image search
• Natural language processing
• Information retrieval
